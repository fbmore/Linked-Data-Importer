# Sketch Linked Data Importer

The plugin imports a CSV file and adds it to your Linked Data tab in Sketch. The generated JSON is ready to be used with the Sketch native function `Linked Data` ([Documentation here](https://www.sketch.com/docs/designing/data/#linked-data)).

`Linked Data` permits to handle Text values and Images. This plugin generates a JSON dictionary that contains all the available (and overrideable) text layers values and images. The JSON file (named after the selected layer) and it Images are stored into a `Lined-Data` folder available inside your Sketch folder.

As soon as you import your dataset, it becomes automatically available in your data set list.
